This file discribes what was done at each checkpoint.

Checkpoint #1:
This was just marking the creation of the repo.

Checkpoint #2:
At this point, I had only defined subtraction. I spent most of the time before
this thinking about the problem and what I needed to do for it. My goal for the
next ckpt was to define division and mod.

Checkpoint #3:
I defined =?, /, and %. I also started working on dividing out factors into 
lists. I now can take a list and a factor and if it is evenly divisible, I can
pull out one instance of that factor and add it to a list. 
ie [ 8 ] 2 = [ 4 , 2 ] or [ 8 , 2 ] 2 = [ 4 , 2 , 2 ]
I also have a safe version of this ( ie. [ 5 ] 2 = [ 5 ] ) but I'm not sure
that this is a function that will actually be needed or it it's functionality
will be incorporated elsewhere.
My goal for the next ckpt is to be able to divide all of the same kind of 
factors out. ( ie. [ 8 ] 2 = [ 2 , 2 , 2 ]
